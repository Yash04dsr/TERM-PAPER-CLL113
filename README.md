# TERM-PAPER-CLL113
This was a term paper made as a course project in the field of **Numerical Computation for Chemical Engineers.**
<br>
**In this Term Paper project as a team we(team of team of 4)**
<br>
A) A comparative study of normal concrete vs self healing bacterial concrete.

B) Achieved **40% improvement** in the seinze model which predict the stress-strain 
behaiviour of self healing concreteby linearising and applying the linear regression.

C) Fitted the stress strain data using **Polynomial interpolation** by lagrange method.
