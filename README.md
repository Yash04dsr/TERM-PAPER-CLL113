# TERM-PAPER-CLL113
This was a term paper made as a course project in the field of **Numerical Computation for Chemical Engineers.**
<br>
**In this Term Paper project as a team we(team of team of 4)**
<br>
  This is A comparative study of normal concrete vs self healing bacterial concrete.

A) Achieved **40% improvement** in the seinze model which predict the stress-strain 
behaiviour of self healing concreteby linearising and applying the linear regression.

B) Fitted the stress strain data using **Polynomial interpolation** by lagrange method. 

C) By this curve by using numerical derivative method (Four point central difference  
   method) found the modulas of elasticity and detailed comaparison of two given concrete.

D) Using the numerical integration method(simpson 3/8 th rule) calculated the energy stored and done the  comparstive study of strenghts of two of the concretes.
