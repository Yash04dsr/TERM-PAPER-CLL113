# TERM-PAPER-CLL113
This was a term paper project made as a course project in the field of **Numerical Computation for Chemical Engineering** in **IIT Delhi**.

This is a **Comparative study of normal concrete vs self healing bacterial concrete**.

A) Developed and implemented a linear regression model to predict the stress-strain behavior of self-healing concrete, resulting in a **40% improvement** in the **Seinze model**

B) Fitted the stress strain data using **Polynomial interpolation** by lagrange method. 

C) Using this curve by using **numerical derivative method** (Four point central difference method) found the modulas of elasticity and detailed comaparison of two of the concrete.

D) Using the numerical integration method(simpson 3/8 th rule) calculated the energy stored and done the  comparstive study of strenghts of two of the concretes.
